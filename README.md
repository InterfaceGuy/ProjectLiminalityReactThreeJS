# Project Liminality: Transcending Knowledge Management

## Introduction

Project Liminality is an innovative knowledge management system that aims to revolutionize the way we structure and interact with information. It transcends the traditional "second brain" paradigm by introducing the concept of an "interbrain" - a dynamic, relational approach to organizing knowledge.

## Core Concepts

### Dream Nodes

The fundamental unit of Project Liminality is the "Dream Node," which is represented by a Git repository. Dream Nodes can embody two primary concepts:

1. **Dreams**: Abstract ideas, concepts, or any form of knowledge.
2. **Dreamers**: Representations of people or peers.

This dual nature allows for a flexible and interconnected knowledge structure.

### Dream Talk and Dream Song

Each Dream Node consists of two main components:

- **Dream Talk**: A concise, symbolic representation of the idea (like a thumbnail).
- **Dream Song**: A more elaborate explanation or exploration of the idea, containing multiple references to other Dream Talks.

### The Interbrain

Project Liminality structures knowledge based on social relationships and interactions, creating an "interbrain." This approach allows users to organize information along the lines of their actual relational fields, transcending static, top-down categorization.

## Key Features

- **Git-Based Structure**: Utilizes Git repositories as the foundation for Dream Nodes, allowing for version control and collaborative evolution of ideas.
- **Relational Organization**: Knowledge is structured based on connections between ideas (Dreams) and people (Dreamers).
- **Holonic Organization**: Facilitates the self-organization of knowledge into a coherent holarchy of ideas.
- **Conversational Copilot**: Designed to enhance and enrich conversations by providing relevant contextual information.
- **Interactive Dream Connections**: Clickable connections between Dream Nodes with visual feedback, enhancing the exploration of relationships between ideas.

## Vision

Project Liminality aims to create a dynamic, interconnected knowledge ecosystem that mirrors the complexity of human thought and social interactions. By breaking down the barriers between personal knowledge management and social discourse, it offers a new paradigm for understanding and evolving ideas in a collaborative, organic manner.
