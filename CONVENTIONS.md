    - Delete `src/3d-classes/DreamNode.js`                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
    - Delete `src/3d-classes/DreamNodeGrid.js`                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 3. Update README.md and any other relevant project documents                                                                                                                                                                                               
 4. Clean up any remaining references to the old implementation                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 ## Phase 9: Final Review and Merge                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 1. Conduct a final code review                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 2. Perform a final round of testing                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 3. Merge the refactoring branch into the main branch                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 4. Tag a new version release                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 ## Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 - Throughout this process, commit changes frequently with clear, descriptive commit messages.                                                                                                                                                              
 - After completing each major phase, run the application to ensure no functionality has been lost.                                                                                                                                                         
 - If any phase introduces unexpected complexity, reassess and adjust the plan as needed.                                                                                                                                                                   
 - Keep track of any performance implications and optimize as necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                    
 - Always use full file paths when referencing files in commit messages or documentation. 

## Progress Summary

As of the latest update, we have successfully completed Phases 1 through 5 of the refactoring plan:

1. Preparation: Completed initial setup and review.
2. File Restructuring: Moved and created necessary files.
3. DreamNode Refactoring: Converted to React component, implemented 3D object creation, state management, interactions, and animations.
4. DreamNodeGrid Refactoring: Converted to React component, implemented layout calculations, rendering of DreamNodes, and interactions.
5. Three.js Integration: Updated ThreeScene.js to use new React components and ensured proper integration.

Key achievements:
- DreamNode.jsx now handles 3D object creation, state management, and interactions.
- DreamNodeGrid.jsx manages multiple DreamNodes, handles layouts, and interactions.
- ThreeScene.js has been updated to work with the new React components.
- Flip animation and hover effects have been implemented in React.
- Media content loading and display are working in the new components.

Current focus:
We are now ready to proceed with Phase 6 (Update Dependencies) and subsequent phases. The refactoring has maintained existing functionality while improving React integration and code structure.

Next steps:
- Review and update other components interacting with DreamNode or DreamNodeGrid.
- Update import statements and ensure correct dependency linking.
- Conduct thorough testing and refinement.
- Update documentation and clean up old implementation files.
