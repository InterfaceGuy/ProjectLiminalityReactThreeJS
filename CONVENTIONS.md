    - Delete `src/3d-classes/DreamNode.js`                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
    - Delete `src/3d-classes/DreamNodeGrid.js`                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 3. Update README.md and any other relevant project documents                                                                                                                                                                                               
 4. Clean up any remaining references to the old implementation                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 ## Phase 9: Final Review and Merge                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 1. Conduct a final code review                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 2. Perform a final round of testing                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 3. Merge the refactoring branch into the main branch                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 4. Tag a new version release                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 ## Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 - Throughout this process, commit changes frequently with clear, descriptive commit messages.                                                                                                                                                              
 - After completing each major phase, run the application to ensure no functionality has been lost.                                                                                                                                                         
 - If any phase introduces unexpected complexity, reassess and adjust the plan as needed.                                                                                                                                                                   
 - Keep track of any performance implications and optimize as necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                    
 - Always use full file paths when referencing files in commit messages or documentation. 

## Progress Summary

As of the latest update, we have partially completed Phases 1 through 5 of the refactoring plan:

1. Preparation: Completed initial setup and review.
2. File Restructuring: Moved and created necessary files.
3. DreamNode Refactoring: Converted to React component, implemented basic structure.
4. DreamNodeGrid Refactoring: Converted to React component, implemented basic structure.
5. Three.js Integration: Started updating ThreeScene.js to use new React components.

Current Status:
- The application is currently not in a working state.
- We are in the process of integrating the refactored React components with the Three.js scene.

Key achievements:
- Basic React component structures for DreamNode.jsx and DreamNodeGrid.jsx have been created.
- Initial implementation of state management and layout calculations in DreamNodeGrid.jsx.
- Started the process of updating ThreeScene.js to work with the new React components.

Current focus and next steps:
1. Complete the integration of DreamNode and DreamNodeGrid components with ThreeScene.js.
2. Implement 3D object creation and management within the React components.
3. Ensure proper data flow between ThreeScene, DreamNodeGrid, and DreamNode components.
4. Implement interactions (click, hover) and animations (flip, layout changes) in the React components.
5. Test and debug the integration to achieve a working state.

Once these steps are completed, we will proceed with:
- Thorough testing and refinement of the new implementation.
- Updating other components that interact with DreamNode or DreamNodeGrid.
- Updating import statements and ensuring correct dependency linking.
- Conducting performance comparisons between old and new implementations.
- Updating documentation and cleaning up old implementation files.

Note for the next AI:
The application is currently in a non-working state as we transition from the Three.js-centric classes to React components. The main task is to complete the integration of the React components with the Three.js scene in ThreeScene.js, ensuring that all 3D functionality is properly implemented within the React component lifecycle.
