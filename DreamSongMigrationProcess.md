# DreamSong Migration Process

This document tracks the progress of the DreamSong migration project. It is updated throughout the development process to reflect completed tasks, current challenges, and next steps.

## How to Use This Document

1. As each task from the DreamSong Migration Plan is started, add it to the "In Progress" section with the date.
2. When a task is completed, move it to the "Completed Tasks" section with the completion date.
3. If any challenges or blockers are encountered, document them in the "Current Challenges" section.
4. Use the "Next Steps" section to outline the immediate upcoming tasks.
5. Add any important notes, decisions, or changes to the plan in the "Notes" section.

## Sections

### Completed Tasks
- [2024-09-08] Created src/utils/fileUtils.js with readDreamSongCanvas and listMediaFiles functions
- [2024-09-08] Updated src/services/electronService.js with readFile and listFiles functions
- [2024-09-08] Created src/utils/dreamSongUtils.js with parseDreamSongCanvas, topologicalSort, and processDreamSongData functions
- [2024-09-08] Updated src/components/DreamSong.js to use the new utility functions
- [2024-09-08] Implemented initial rendering logic for the linear flow of elements in DreamSong.js
- [2024-09-08] Added basic click handling for media files in DreamSong.js

### In Progress
- [2024-09-08] Refining and testing the DreamSong component implementation

### Current Challenges
- Ensuring proper integration of the DreamSong component with the existing Dreamgraph structure
- Handling potential edge cases in the DreamSong canvas data parsing and rendering

### Next Steps
- Test the DreamSong component with various canvas data structures to ensure robustness
- Implement error handling and fallback rendering for incomplete or malformed canvas data
- Integrate the DreamSong component more tightly with the Dreamgraph component
- Implement smooth transitions and animations for the linear flow rendering
- Optimize performance for large DreamSong canvas files

### Notes
- The topological sort function includes a check for cycles in the graph, which might be useful for error handling or future improvements.
- The current implementation assumes a specific structure for the DreamSong canvas data. We may need to make it more flexible to handle variations in the data format.
- Consider implementing a caching mechanism for parsed DreamSong data to improve performance on subsequent renders.
- The legacy code in linearFlowCanvas.js provides valuable insights into handling complex rendering scenarios, which we should incorporate into our React implementation.
