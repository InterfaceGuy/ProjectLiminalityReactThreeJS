# DreamSpace Optimization Plan

## 1. DreamSong.canvas File Error Fix
- Complexity: Low
- Approach: Implement a check before attempting to read the file
- Expected impact: Reduce console errors, slight performance improvement
- Implementation time: 1-2 hours

## 2. Minimal Initial Loading for DreamNodes
- Complexity: Medium
- Approach: Only load the primary DreamTalk component by default
- Expected impact: Significant reduction in initial memory usage
- Implementation time: 4-8 hours

## 3. Event-Driven Component Creation
- Complexity: Medium to High
- Approach: Load additional components (DreamSong, DreamContent) when specific user interactions occur
- Expected impact: Significant reduction in memory usage
- Implementation time: 8-16 hours

## 4. Data Preparation vs. Visualization
- Complexity: Medium
- Approach: Store necessary data (like directory structure) but delay creating visual components until needed
- Expected impact: Improved performance, especially for large repositories
- Implementation time: 6-12 hours

## Implementation Plan

1. Fix DreamSong.canvas file errors
2. Refactor DreamNode to only load primary DreamTalk initially
   - Store paths/data for other components but don't create them yet
   - Implement event handlers for flip button and carousel navigation
3. Create a system for on-demand component creation
   - When flip button is clicked, create and render DreamContent
   - When carousel buttons are clicked, create and render additional DreamTalk/DreamSong components
4. Implement a cleanup system to destroy unused components when they're no longer needed

## Overall Project Estimates
- Complexity: Medium
- Expected Impact: Significant reduction in memory usage and improved performance
- Total Implementation Time: 20-40 hours (including testing and refinement)

## Notes
- Continually test and monitor performance throughout implementation
- Be prepared to adjust approach based on performance gains and challenges encountered
- This plan combines manual control with optimized loading, tailored to the DreamSpace application structure
