# Undo/Redo Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview

The goal of this implementation plan is to add undo and redo functionality to the DreamGraph application. This feature will allow users to reverse their actions (undo) or reapply previously undone actions (redo), providing a more flexible and forgiving user experience.

The undo/redo system will track user actions such as node clicks and layout changes, storing these actions in a history stack. Users will be able to navigate through this history using keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+Z for undo, Cmd+Shift+Z for redo) or potentially through UI buttons.

A key challenge in implementing this feature is to ensure that the visual state of the application accurately reflects the current position in the action history, even when rapidly undoing or redoing multiple actions. To address this, we'll implement a "shadow mode" that allows actions to be replayed without being added to the history stack.

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. Set up Redux
- [ ] Install dependencies (redux, react-redux, @reduxjs/toolkit)
   - These libraries will provide the state management infrastructure needed for the undo/redo feature.
- [ ] Create store (src/store/index.js)
   - This will serve as the central state container for the application.
- [ ] Set up history reducer (src/store/historySlice.js)
   - This reducer will manage the undo/redo history stack.

### 2. Modify DreamGraph Component
- [ ] Implement action creators for node clicks and escape key presses
   - These will standardize how these actions are represented in the Redux store.
- [ ] Dispatch these actions to the Redux store
   - This ensures that all relevant user actions are captured in the history.
- [ ] Connect the DreamGraph component to the Redux store
   - This allows the component to access and update the global state.

### 3. Update App Component
- [ ] Add keyboard event listeners for undo (Cmd+Z) and redo (Cmd+Shift+Z)
   - This provides the user interface for triggering undo and redo actions.
- [ ] Dispatch undo and redo actions to the Redux store
   - This initiates the process of undoing or redoing actions.

### 4. Enhance History Reducer
- [ ] Refine the state structure to focus on last action
   - This optimization allows for more efficient undo/redo operations.
- [ ] Implement undo and redo functionality
   - This includes logic for moving backwards and forwards through the action history.

### 5. Create Middleware for Side Effects
- [ ] Intercept actions and trigger appropriate changes in DreamGraph
   - This ensures that the visual state of the application is updated correctly when undoing or redoing actions.
- [ ] Implement "shadow mode" for replaying actions without adding to history
   - This allows for efficient replaying of actions when undoing or redoing multiple steps.

### 6. Update DreamGraph for Shadow Mode
- [ ] Modify handleNodeClick and handleEscapeKey to accept "addToHistory" parameter
   - This allows these functions to behave differently when in shadow mode.
- [ ] Only dispatch actions to store when not in shadow mode
   - This prevents actions from being added to the history stack during undo/redo operations.

### 7. Connect and Test
- [ ] Ensure Redux store is properly connected to React components
   - This verifies that all components can access and update the global state as needed.
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing for undo/redo functionality
   - This includes unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the entire feature.
- [ ] Debug and refine as necessary
   - This step involves identifying and fixing any issues that arise during testing.

### 8. Optimization and Refactoring
- [ ] Review implementation for potential optimizations
   - This could include performance improvements or more efficient state management.
- [ ] Refactor code for clarity and maintainability
   - This ensures that the codebase remains clean and easy to understand.
- [ ] Update documentation and comments
   - This helps future developers understand the implementation and rationale behind design decisions.

### 9. Final Testing and Review
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing of the entire feature
   - This includes edge cases and potential user scenarios.
- [ ] Review code for adherence to project standards and best practices
   - This ensures consistency with the rest of the codebase.
- [ ] Address any remaining issues or edge cases
   - This final step catches any lingering problems before considering the feature complete.

## Rationale for Implementation Details

1. **Use of Redux**: Redux provides a predictable state container, which is crucial for implementing undo/redo functionality. It allows us to easily track and manage the history of actions.

2. **Shadow Mode**: This is implemented to handle the complexity of rapidly undoing or redoing multiple actions. It allows us to replay actions without adding them to the history stack, ensuring that the visual state of the application remains consistent with the current position in the action history.

3. **Focus on Last Action**: By structuring the state to focus on the last action, we can implement undo and redo more efficiently. This approach allows us to move backwards and forwards through the history without having to replay all actions from the beginning each time.

4. **Middleware for Side Effects**: Using middleware allows us to intercept actions and trigger appropriate changes in the DreamGraph component. This separation of concerns keeps our reducer pure while still allowing us to handle complex side effects.

5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Given the complexity of the undo/redo feature and its potential to affect the entire application state, thorough testing is crucial to ensure reliability and catch edge cases.

By following this plan, we'll be able to implement a robust and efficient undo/redo system that enhances the user experience of the DreamGraph application.
