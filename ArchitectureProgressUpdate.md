# Architecture Implementation Progress

## Current Focus: Single DreamNode in DreamSpace

### Milestone 1: Implement Basic DreamNode and DreamSpace (Completed)

#### Achievements:
1. Created a functional DreamNode component
   - [x] Implemented basic structure with CSS3DObject
   - [x] Added state management for visibility, location, size, and rotation
   - [x] Implemented user interaction handlers (hover, click)

2. Developed DreamSpace component
   - [x] Set up Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
   - [x] Integrated CSS3DRenderer for DreamNode display
   - [x] Implemented basic 3D environment

3. Displayed single DreamNode in DreamSpace
   - [x] Rendered DreamNode within DreamSpace
   - [x] Ensured proper 3D positioning and interaction

4. Basic data integration
   - [x] Implemented metadata reading from the first git repository in DreamVault
   - [x] Displayed repository information in DreamNode

### Milestone 2: Enhance DreamNode Functionality and User Experience (In Progress)

#### Objectives:
1. Refine DreamNode appearance and behavior
   - [x] Improved visual design of DreamTalk and DreamSong components
   - [x] Implemented proper opacity and visibility handling for front and back faces
   - [ ] Enhance animation smoothness for hover and click interactions

2. Optimize performance
   - [x] Implemented efficient rendering techniques for CSS3DObject
   - [ ] Further optimize Three.js scene management

3. Implement advanced user interactions
   - [x] Implemented rotation of DreamNode to view front and back sides
   - [ ] Add zoom functionality to focus on selected DreamNode

4. Enhance data integration
   - [x] Implemented comprehensive metadata display
   - [x] Added support for different media types (images, videos) in DreamTalk

### Current Progress Notes:
- Successfully implemented a single DreamNode with both DreamTalk and DreamSong components as front and back faces
- Integrated CSS3DObject for efficient 3D representation
- Implemented user interactions (hover, click) using raycasting in DreamSpace
- Set up DreamSpace with Three.js and CSS3DRenderer
- Achieved proper rendering and positioning of DreamNode in 3D space
- Implemented metadata reading and display for the first git repository
- Successfully displayed media files (images, videos) on the DreamTalk side of the DreamNode

### Next Steps:
- Complete remaining objectives in Milestone 2
- Refine and optimize the single DreamNode experience
- Explore potential for multiple DreamNodes implementation

### Known Issues and Future Improvements:

1. **Media File Prioritization**: 
   - **Description**: The current implementation of file format prioritization in the `getPreferredMediaFile` function needs refinement.
   - **Impact**: This may result in suboptimal media file selection for DreamNodes.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Planned Solution**: Refactor the `getPreferredMediaFile` function to correctly apply the prioritization logic.
   - **Target Timeline**: To be addressed in the next refactoring phase.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **Description**: While the current implementation works well for a single DreamNode, further optimization may be needed.
   - **Impact**: Potential for improved performance and smoother interactions.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Planned Solution**: Implement additional optimization techniques for Three.js scene management and CSS3DObject rendering.
   - **Target Timeline**: Ongoing, with focus after completing Milestone 2 objectives.

3. **Enhanced User Interactions**:
   - **Description**: Additional interactive features could improve user experience.
   - **Impact**: Potential for more engaging and intuitive user interactions.
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Planned Solution**: Explore and implement additional interactive features such as zooming, panning, or gesture controls.
   - **Target Timeline**: To be considered after completing current Milestone 2 objectives.

These improvements will be addressed in future development iterations, prioritized based on their impact on core functionality and user experience.
