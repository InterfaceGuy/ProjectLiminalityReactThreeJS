# Architecture Implementation Progress

## Current Focus: Single DreamNode in DreamSpace

### Milestone 1: Implement Basic DreamNode and DreamSpace

#### Objectives:
1. Create a functional DreamNode component
   - [ ] Implement basic structure with CSS 3D transforms
   - [ ] Add state management for visibility, location, size, and rotation
   - [ ] Implement user interaction handlers (hover, click)

2. Develop DreamSpace component
   - [ ] Set up Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
   - [ ] Integrate CSS3DRenderer for DreamNode display
   - [ ] Implement basic 3D environment

3. Display single DreamNode in DreamSpace
   - [ ] Render DreamNode within DreamSpace
   - [ ] Ensure proper 3D positioning and interaction

4. Basic data integration
   - [ ] Implement simple metadata reading from the first git repository in DreamVault
   - [ ] Display basic repository information in DreamNode

#### Simplified Approach:
- Focus on rendering only one DreamNode for the first Git repository in the DreamVault
- Temporarily ignore other repositories to streamline development and testing

#### Next Steps:
- Once Milestone 1 is complete with a single DreamNode, we'll implement DreamTalk and DreamSong components within it.
- After that, we'll expand to multiple DreamNodes and implement the DreamGraph component for coordination.

#### Progress Notes:
- Decided to simplify initial implementation by focusing on a single DreamNode
- This approach will allow for faster iteration and easier debugging of core functionality
