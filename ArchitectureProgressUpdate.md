### Milestone 3: Refactor for Scalable Architecture (In Progress)

#### Objectives:
1. Implement DreamNode3D class
   - [ ] Create custom Three.js Object3D subclass for DreamNode
   - [ ] Integrate CSS3DObject and interaction planes into DreamNode3D

2. Refactor DreamNode React component
   - [ ] Update to manage DreamNode3D instance
   - [ ] Implement useRef and useEffect for Three.js object lifecycle management

3. Update DreamSpace component
   - [ ] Modify to work with new DreamNode and DreamNode3D structure
   - [ ] Implement raycasting for multiple DreamNode3D objects

4. Implement 3D transformations
   - [ ] Add functions for positioning, rotating, and scaling DreamNodes in 3D space
   - [ ] Ensure transformations apply to entire DreamNode3D object (including interaction planes)

5. Optimize for multiple DreamNodes
   - [ ] Implement efficient rendering and interaction detection for multiple nodes
   - [ ] Consider implementing frustum culling or octree structures for large numbers of nodes

### Current Progress Notes:
- Successfully implemented single DreamNode with front (DreamTalk) and back (DreamSong) faces
- Achieved integration of CSS3DObject for efficient 3D representation
- Implemented user interactions (hover, click) using raycasting in DreamSpace
- Developed a clear plan for refactoring towards a more scalable architecture
- Identified key components for the new structure: DreamNode3D (Three.js object) and DreamNode (React component)

### Next Steps:
- Begin implementation of DreamNode3D class
- Refactor DreamNode React component to work with DreamNode3D
- Update DreamSpace to handle multiple DreamNode instances
- Implement and test 3D transformations for DreamNodes

### Known Issues and Future Improvements:

1. **Scalability for Multiple DreamNodes**: 
   - **Description**: Current implementation is optimized for a single DreamNode. Needs refactoring for efficient handling of multiple nodes.
   - **Impact**: Essential for creating a full 3D space with multiple repositories.
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Planned Solution**: Implement DreamNode3D class and refactor components as outlined in Milestone 3.
   - **Target Timeline**: To be addressed in the current development phase.

2. **Performance Optimization for Large Numbers of Nodes**:
   - **Description**: Current implementation may not scale well for very large numbers of DreamNodes.
   - **Impact**: Potential performance issues in scenarios with many repositories.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Planned Solution**: Implement advanced optimization techniques like frustum culling or octree structures.
   - **Target Timeline**: To be addressed after basic multi-node functionality is implemented.

3. **Advanced User Interactions in 3D Space**:
   - **Description**: Current interactions are basic. More advanced 3D interactions could enhance user experience.
   - **Impact**: Potential for more intuitive and engaging user experience in 3D space.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Planned Solution**: Implement advanced camera controls, gesture recognition, and 3D UI elements.
   - **Target Timeline**: To be considered after completing Milestone 3 objectives.

4. **Integration with Git Functionality**:
   - **Description**: Current implementation focuses on display. Deeper integration with git operations is needed.
   - **Impact**: Essential for full functionality as a git repository visualization tool.
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Planned Solution**: Implement git operations and real-time updates for DreamNodes.
   - **Target Timeline**: To be addressed in parallel with Milestone 3 implementation.

These improvements and next steps are crucial for evolving the project into a fully-functional, scalable 3D visualization tool for git repositories. The focus is on creating a robust architecture that combines the strengths of React and Three.js while maintaining performance and user experience.
