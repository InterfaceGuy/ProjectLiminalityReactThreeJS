# Architecture Implementation Progress

## Current Focus: Single DreamNode in DreamSpace

### Milestone 1: Implement Basic DreamNode and DreamSpace

#### Objectives:
1. Create a functional DreamNode component
   - [x] Implement basic structure with CSS 3D transforms
   - [x] Add state management for visibility, location, size, and rotation
   - [x] Implement user interaction handlers (hover, click)

2. Develop DreamSpace component
   - [x] Set up Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
   - [x] Integrate CSS3DRenderer for DreamNode display
   - [x] Implement basic 3D environment

3. Display single DreamNode in DreamSpace
   - [x] Render DreamNode within DreamSpace
   - [x] Ensure proper 3D positioning and interaction

4. Basic data integration
   - [x] Implement simple metadata reading from the first git repository in DreamVault
   - [x] Display basic repository information in DreamNode

#### Progress Notes:
- Successfully implemented a single DreamNode with both DreamTalk and DreamSong components
- Integrated CSS3D transforms for 3D representation
- Implemented basic user interactions (hover, click)
- Set up DreamSpace with Three.js and CSS3DRenderer
- Achieved proper rendering and positioning of DreamNode in 3D space
- Implemented metadata reading and display for the first git repository

### Milestone 2: Enhance DreamNode Functionality and User Experience

#### Objectives:
1. Refine DreamNode appearance and behavior
   - [ ] Improve visual design of DreamTalk and DreamSong components
   - [ ] Enhance animation smoothness for hover and click interactions
   - [ ] Implement proper opacity and visibility handling for front and back faces

2. Optimize performance
   - [ ] Implement efficient rendering techniques for CSS3D objects
   - [ ] Optimize Three.js scene management

3. Implement advanced user interactions
   - [ ] Add zoom functionality to focus on selected DreamNode
   - [ ] Implement rotation of DreamNode to view front and back sides

4. Enhance data integration
   - [ ] Implement more comprehensive metadata display
   - [ ] Add support for different media types (images, audio, video) in DreamTalk

#### Next Steps:
- Begin working on Milestone 2 objectives
- Once Milestone 2 is complete, we'll move on to implementing multiple DreamNodes and the DreamGraph component for coordination

#### Long-term Goals:
- Implement DreamGraph for managing multiple DreamNodes
- Develop advanced navigation and interaction within the DreamSpace
- Integrate with the broader DreamCatcher ecosystem
