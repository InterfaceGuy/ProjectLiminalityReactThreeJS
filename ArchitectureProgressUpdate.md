# Architecture Implementation Progress

## Current Focus: Single DreamNode in DreamSpace

### Milestone 1: Implement Basic DreamNode and DreamSpace

#### Objectives:
1. Create a functional DreamNode component
   - [x] Implement basic structure with CSS 3D transforms
   - [x] Add state management for visibility, location, size, and rotation
   - [x] Implement user interaction handlers (hover, click)

2. Develop DreamSpace component
   - [x] Set up Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
   - [x] Integrate CSS3DRenderer for DreamNode display
   - [x] Implement basic 3D environment

3. Display single DreamNode in DreamSpace
   - [x] Render DreamNode within DreamSpace
   - [x] Ensure proper 3D positioning and interaction

4. Basic data integration
   - [x] Implement simple metadata reading from the first git repository in DreamVault
   - [x] Display basic repository information in DreamNode

#### Progress Notes:
- Successfully implemented a single DreamNode with both DreamTalk and DreamSong components
- Integrated CSS3D transforms for 3D representation
- Implemented basic user interactions (hover, click)
- Set up DreamSpace with Three.js and CSS3DRenderer
- Achieved proper rendering and positioning of DreamNode in 3D space
- Implemented metadata reading and display for the first git repository
- Successfully displayed media files (images, videos) on the DreamTalk side of the DreamNode

### Milestone 2: Enhance DreamNode Functionality and User Experience

#### Objectives:
1. Refine DreamNode appearance and behavior
   - [x] Improve visual design of DreamTalk and DreamSong components
   - [ ] Enhance animation smoothness for hover and click interactions
   - [x] Implement proper opacity and visibility handling for front and back faces

2. Optimize performance
   - [x] Implement efficient rendering techniques for CSS3D objects
   - [ ] Optimize Three.js scene management

3. Implement advanced user interactions
   - [ ] Add zoom functionality to focus on selected DreamNode
   - [x] Implement rotation of DreamNode to view front and back sides

4. Enhance data integration
   - [x] Implement more comprehensive metadata display
   - [x] Add support for different media types (images, audio, video) in DreamTalk

#### Next Steps:
- Complete remaining objectives in Milestone 2
- Begin planning for multiple DreamNodes implementation
- Start designing the DreamGraph component for coordinating multiple DreamNodes

#### Long-term Goals:
- Implement DreamGraph for managing multiple DreamNodes
- Develop advanced navigation and interaction within the DreamSpace
- Integrate with the broader DreamCatcher ecosystem

### Known Issues and Future Improvements:

1. **Media File Prioritization**: 
   - **Description**: The current implementation of file format prioritization in the `getPreferredMediaFile` function is not working correctly. The function should prioritize certain file formats over others (e.g., .gif over .mp4 over .png), but this is not being applied properly.
   - **Impact**: This may result in suboptimal media file selection for DreamNodes, potentially affecting the user experience.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Planned Solution**: Refactor the `getPreferredMediaFile` function to correctly apply the prioritization logic. This will involve revisiting the sorting algorithm used for file selection.
   - **Target Timeline**: To be addressed in the next refactoring phase, after core functionality is stable.

2. **Performance Optimization for Multiple DreamNodes**:
   - **Description**: The current implementation works well for a single DreamNode, but may face performance issues with multiple nodes.
   - **Impact**: Potential slowdowns or rendering issues in the DreamSpace when many DreamNodes are present.
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Planned Solution**: Implement efficient rendering techniques, possibly including level-of-detail (LOD) systems or object pooling for DreamNodes.
   - **Target Timeline**: To be addressed as part of the multiple DreamNodes implementation phase.

These issues are acknowledged and will be addressed in future development iterations. The team will prioritize them based on their impact on core functionality and user experience.
