3. Updated DreamSpace component
   - [x] Modified to work with new DreamNode and DreamNode3D structure
   - [x] Implemented raycasting for DreamNode3D objects

4. Implemented 3D transformations
   - [x] Added functions for positioning, rotating, and scaling DreamNodes in 3D space
   - [x] Ensured transformations apply to entire DreamNode3D object (including interaction planes)

#### Remaining Objectives:
5. Optimize for multiple DreamNodes
   - [ ] Implement efficient rendering and interaction detection for multiple nodes
   - [ ] Consider implementing frustum culling or octree structures for large numbers of nodes

### Current Progress Notes:
- Successfully refactored DreamNode to use DreamNode3D, improving separation of concerns
- Implemented DreamNode3D as a custom Three.js Object3D subclass, encapsulating 3D-specific logic
- Updated DreamSpace to work with the new DreamNode and DreamNode3D structure
- Achieved better integration between React components and Three.js objects
- Improved 3D transformations (position, rotation, scale) for DreamNodes

### Next Steps:
- Implement DreamGraph component as the central conductor for the 3D space
- Refactor DreamNode to handle self-contained interactions and communicate with DreamGraph
- Implement support for multiple DreamNodes in DreamSpace
- Optimize rendering and interaction detection for multiple nodes
- Implement advanced 3D space management (e.g., node positioning algorithms)
- Enhance user interactions in 3D space (e.g., camera controls, gestures)
- Begin integration of more advanced git functionality
