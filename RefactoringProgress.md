# Refactoring Progress

## Completed Tasks
- Created RefactoringProgress.md to track the refactoring process
- Set up React Three Fiber in the project (already present in package.json)
- Refactored DreamSpace to use R3F Canvas
- Converted DreamNode React component to an R3F component (DreamNode3DR3F)
- Preserved camera movement functionality
- Implemented hover state for nodes
- Added node count display
- Updated DreamNode3DR3F component to use Html component from @react-three/drei
- Removed CSS3DObject import and related code
- Implemented Billboard component from @react-three/drei for DreamNode3DR3F
- Integrated Html components for rendering DreamTalk and DreamSong within Billboard
- Implemented basic hover and click functionality using R3F patterns
- Integrated data fetching within DreamNode3DR3F component

## In Progress
- Refining state management and event handling in DreamNode3DR3F
- Optimizing 3D interactions and performance
- Implementing smooth transitions for hover and flip animations

## Upcoming Tasks
- Implement advanced node interactions (e.g., scaling based on data)
- Refactor camera controls to use R3F compatible solutions
- Thorough testing of each converted component
- Update documentation to reflect new architecture
- Optimize performance for larger numbers of nodes

## Notes
- The RefactoringPlan.md has been updated to reflect our current approach
- The transition to using Billboard and Html from @react-three/drei has significantly simplified our component structure
- We've successfully integrated 3D functionality with React components, allowing for more flexible and maintainable code
- The new structure allows for easier scaling, positioning, and rotation of nodes in 3D space
- We've maintained the ability to render HTML content (DreamTalk and DreamSong) within our 3D environment
- The refactoring process has opened up possibilities for more advanced 3D interactions and visualizations

Next steps will focus on refining the implementation, ensuring smooth performance, and expanding the functionality of our 3D environment.
